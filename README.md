# Resy-API

This is an attempt at creating a javascript client for Resy. The code from Resy's homepage is in the `src/minifiedSourceCode` - it's more feature full and has more routes than my client, but is a bit harder to read because it's been minified.

The `src/controllers` has the cleaner code that's meant for more programmatic use.
